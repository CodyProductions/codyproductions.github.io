          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Cody Productions is an indie game dev who started making games in 2016 on a website called sploder.io which is basically just a playground for stuff. In 2019 he still had that game dev feeling, the fun, the happiness, the excitement. He started looking up how to make games and found this web engine called "GDevelop" He played around with it in the browser for a bit and then decided to download it. He made his first game which was called PewDiePie's Space Mission. It was a template that he re sprited and made it so the player has a PewDiePie logo on it and the enemies had a tseries logo on it. It was pretty quick but fun to make. He started messing around with stuff and creating games such as: Stupid Wheels Demo, Ragdoll Game, Text To Speech, UP & DOWN. He had fun working on these little projects but it got kinda boring after since the engine was kinda limited and wasn't so fun to use after. He started looking around for engines when he saw "Godot Engine" He saw that it was 3D and that was an instant download, that's the stuff I wanna make! He started playing around with it having absolutely no knowledge of game development or programming except for GDevelop and Sploder.io which didn't even have a programming language (sploder.io) He started creating some projects like: Can you find it: Itch.io Web Version (Demo) which was just a template from Godot, Then made The Walking Simulator which was also just a template renamed. It got boring afterwards. He later found Unity and started trying to work on real games, but that's kinda hard when you just start stuff and jump right in without that much knowledge. He made some projects like: A Day In a Birds Life, Cash Clicker but it's not family friendly, My Fat Dog Grace's game. It was fun but hard to master at that time. It's now early summer 2020. He found an engine called GameMaker Studio 2 that he'd heard of before, It peaked his interest and he downloaded the trial version. He found that making games/projects with the DnD scripting language was super fun and exciting, he made a little game that he spent around 2 hours on which was just a testing project. This excitement really got him more into it. Some days later he was at a place and and took pictures of it to make a game of, but he wanted to pixelate all of them and change the format to .png but it got too annoying, messy and confusing so he dropped it. A few hours or days later he started randomly working on a game called "Farmer". He learned some more stuff in DnD and showed it to his nephew and niece. He asked his niece to voice act as a story character but then his nephew wanted to join so he got to voice the bartender and Cody voiced the main character. Due to his limited knowledge of DnD he tried to expand it but it got too tiring and so he dropped it. Months later in 2020 now. Cody picked up the Unity engine once again for another ride. He started watching tutorials and was gonna make his flappy bird clone called "Flappy Burd" Every developer has probably created either a minecraft or flappy bird clone. He made animations and a titlescreen for it but then started playing around with other stuff so he didn't work on it. 16th august 2020, He launched the Unity Hub and made a 3D Project called "Horror game whatever" He took some old movement scripts that were super glitchy and bad. Some hours later after doing something else he picked it up and started working on it a little more, watching brackeys 3D movement tutorials and etc. He got some tree models from earliers and now he had a working game, cool! Now what? He got more into it and started working on it a little bit but then it got late and he went to sleep, Next day he started showing off the game to his nephew and was excited for it. a few days/weeks later. School has started, Finally.. 7th grade. He was chilling with his friend all day and told him about a game he's been working on for a few weeks. His friend thought it was cool and then he asked some stuff about it (and I answered of course lmfao 😂) His friend told a really chill teacher about it and then he asked some questions on what I was using to work on it with (aaand I answered of course Haha) Some weeks later he and his friend thought about some ideas for the game and they were awesome. 2021. After I had taken an 8 months break from the game I picked it up again and started working on it. Now that I got more C# Knowledge I could make it better. Cody gained some followers and viewers on TikTok and then it got good after that. Months later. Now I'm here, writing about myself in third person, on a website, for like 30 minutes. I've worked on it and started working on 2 other games too! I've gotten into acting and I'm hoping to pursue my career from there. Now I got 3 websites. codydakotarubenack.oom, starwarsforums.net and codyprod. I'm still working on Horror Woods, I have a friend that is voice acting, a backstory and I'm so excited.
